        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (1949–1993) was a Colombian drug lord and the leader of the Medellín Cartel, infamous for his role in the global cocaine trade. Known as "The King of Cocaine," Escobar became one of the wealthiest men in the world, with a net worth estimated at $25–30 billion at his peak. His cartel controlled 80% of the cocaine smuggled into the U.S., generating immense profits.<br><br>
          
            Despite his criminal empire, Escobar gained a "Robin Hood" reputation for funding housing, schools, and sports fields for the poor. However, his violent reign led to the deaths of thousands, including politicians, police, and civilians. After a brief stint in his own luxurious prison, Escobar escaped, and in 1993, he was killed in a shootout with Colombian police.<br><br>
          
            His life remains a symbol of the brutal power and wealth associated with the international drug trade.

            Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (born December 1, 1949, Rionegro, Colombia—died December 2, 1993, Medellín), was a Colombian drug lord and narcoterrorist who founded and led the Medellín Cartel. Known as "The King of Cocaine," Escobar was one of the wealthiest criminals in history, amassing billions of dollars during his career in the drug trade.
            <br><br>
            Escobar began his criminal career in the early 1970s and became the most powerful drug trafficker in Colombia by the 1980s. He was responsible for shipping vast quantities of cocaine to the United States and was both loved and feared in Colombia. His reign of terror included bombings and assassinations, but he also provided housing, schools, and football fields for the poor.
